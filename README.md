# Research Report for CMSC 221: Intro to Programming Languages

## Authors
Elizabeth Crowdus (code, co-author of report), Maxine King (co-author of report)

## Assignment
Write a report about the research paper, 'Design of a Functional Image Library', by Matthew Findler, Robert Bruce, and Ian Flatt.

In order to learn about the functional image library designed by the authors of the paper, I wrote a simple Racket program using the library. The Racket program makes a graphic of a lambda symbol dressed up like a lion. 

## Running the Racket program
1. Install [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org)
1. Open the DrRacket application 
1. Racket -> Run
1. Type `ll` in the shell. Hit enter.
